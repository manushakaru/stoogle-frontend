Edit 1 - More information in my case - 
Daughter 20 months. Current temperature is 36.7. Currently sitting infront the tv having a cuddle. She‚Äôs been changed, snack, watered. Am I missing any other checks?

Edit 2 - thanks guys. It‚Äôs really interesting reading the research and methods and mostly your experiences. Never expected to get so many comments.

Edit 3 - (update &amp; overview) wow the amount of comments is absolutely mind blowing. I cannot keep up. So she was up at 1:30am, I think she‚Äôs now down and it‚Äôs 4:11am. I‚Äôm now wide awake so will have to be grateful for my 3 hours I had before she woke up. Gotta go work in a 4 hours. So we spent a lot of time cuddling and watching tv. Tried her in the buggy with an automated rocker (some times works) and tried to put her back in her cot 3 times before the final 4th. She even let me to the cot one of those times but then realised very quickly she didn‚Äôt wanna be in it. On the fourth time she got the hump and wouldn‚Äôt even hold my hand but through sheer tiredness has passed out. 

It‚Äôs really interesting to hear every one‚Äôs experiences and opinions. I do wish to clarify. We have a strict bedtime routine (bath, warm milk then bed) will expand this and adapt this as time passes. I feel to young for the story. It would bore her awake) 

I have done any sleep training and have always wondered the what ifs. 

It seems from every thing I have read there‚Äôs a strong divide between views and opinions as expected but I just wanted every one to take away from this that every child is different and requires different needs. But ultimately we all agree that as long as ur child is loved and cared for, then your doing some thing right. 

My only comment for those whom are strongly against all methods of sleep training‚Ä¶. I ask you to ponder if it is worth trying if it means for some people saving a marriage, saving a job (which can lead to bigger problems including mortgages, bills and even putting food on the table, then I ask please just keep in mind that every ones situation is different and every ones situation is individual.

reddit,Oppose,"The thing you need to understand on this topic is what is driving a child to cry at night.

Human babies *need* attention. I do not mean that in the sense of them *wanting* it; I mean that it is a profound survival instinct driving their need for their parents. Human babies are helpless compared to other mammals. Their neurological development is spurred primarily by social interaction. Human babies who are not touched, held or interacted with *will* fail to thrive. Not being given attention weakens their immune systems, raises the risk of SIDS - it can straight up kill them. And on an instinctive level, they know that.

A baby who is left alone does *not* understand you are coming back. They do not ‚Äòlearn‚Äô that you are coming back. Their instincts are telling them they have been abandoned and they are going to die. They use their only tool to communicate their terror - crying for help - and their parents ignore them to their face, put them down, and walk away.

The studies which have been done to monitor the distress levels of children left to cry it out are universally conclusive. The babies‚Äô systems flood with stress hormones, their blood pressure goes up, and they show every biological sign of serious distress. Now, importantly, you need to understand that in the phase where parents say the baby then ‚Äúcalms down‚Äù and ‚Äúlearns‚Äù to sleep, what the biometrics say is that *the baby remains in that heightened state of distress until they eventually pass out from sheer exhaustion*.

The quiet is not calm; it is a child who is utterly terrified becoming too exhausted to sustain calling for help, and accepting that *their parents will not help them when they are in need*.

Babies left to ‚Äúcry it out‚Äù do indeed become less demanding. They in effect shut down; they cease communicating their needs to their parents, emotional or physical, because they have learned that their parents will not meet their needs.

Beginning to employ ‚Äúcry it out‚Äù - or as you can more accurately call it, beginning to purposefully neglect your baby in order to make them more compliant for your own convenience - pretty immediately results in the baby‚Äôs attachment behaviours toward their parents degrading. They very visibly start to behave as if their parents are no longer a safe place or a source of comfort. All while their parents beam proudly about how well they have ‚Äútrained‚Äù their child, the same way some owners brag about training a dog by starving it until it complies.

Speaking as a mental health professional - I loathe having to work with patients who are treating their children like this, because I have to keep my cool face on and slowly work with them to improve their ability to connect with their children and push back against these damaging practices, without being able to just say *what the hell is wrong with you? Don‚Äôt you understand that screaming means they are upset? What is being communicated here isn‚Äôt a fucking mystery!*

But I can say that online to people I don‚Äôt have a professional relationship with!

Leaving your child to scream in order to teach them that screaming for help is futile is cruel. It is harmful. Insecure attachment in infants *is* a predictor of poor mental health in adulthood.

If infant attachment were as fragile as you seem to imply, and a single or even a handful of instances of being not responded to damaged it irreparably, we would all have chaotic attachment styles.

reddit,Advocate,"I was very anti sleep training for the entire first year.  My husband suggested it from time to time but I always shut it down.  Her sleep just kept getting progressively worse.  Eventually I wasn‚Äôt getting stretches longer than 2 hours and she would often wake up 30-45 minutes after being put down, sometimes even 15 minutes after.  I was so miserable.  I was afraid to drive most days because I was so tired.  It was becoming literally dangerous.  I started wishing I was the kind of person that would sleep train.  And eventually that fantasizing turned into serious consideration.  I told my husband I was thinking about it and he was of course very supportive.  We researched all  the various strategies and landed on ‚Äúcry it out‚Äù because we felt it would be the quickest, most effective method for us and our kid.

Night 1 she cried 5 minutes, then slept through the night.  Night 2 she cried 5 minutes, then slept through the night.  And every night since then she‚Äôs slept through the entire night.  11+ hours.  Now we can put her in her crib completely awake and she falls asleep without any fussing within minutes.

When they were around your daughters age (my youngest actually is 23 months, so not far off from your child) if they were doing a constant cry/scream/yell situation nobody was sitting around just listening.

If it‚Äôs a health issue (cold/congestion or teething pains) we deal with that. Otherwise, we Let them know that it‚Äôs time to sleep, it‚Äôs not time to play (if talking/playing is what they were crying for). Depending on how young, rub their back or pat their legs softly.

reddit,Advocate,"Are you asking if you should cry it out or if you should sleep train. These are two very different questions.  CIO is a method of sleep training but there are many methods. Lots of people choose to sleep train. 

Others have already posted studies that show there are no known harmful effects of straight up CIO. But if you object to CIO, definitely don‚Äôt do it. 

The real question is - is your family‚Äôs sleep situation working for everyone in your family? If the answer is no, then you need to make a change. That doesn‚Äôt mean you need to CIO. But you do need to make a change. Because everyone‚Äôs sleep is important. Babies need a lot of sleep and adults need sleep too. If you‚Äôre worried about negative impacts on physical health and mental health, look in to the impacts of poor sleep and not enough sleep. There‚Äôs tons of strong research that shows how much this impacts babies and adults. 

I‚Äôm super passionate about sleep. We sleep trained our kids but didn‚Äôt do straight up CIO. We did gradual retreat (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called).

My son always slept better with someone else and we elected not to sleep train (his adoption and early health issues made us concerned about attachment). He shared a room with his sister until they were 9 and 8 and came into our room many of those nights. He eventually stopped cosleeping on his own.

reddit,No Position,"We tried the Ferber method at 4 months, then again at 6 months. I was under so much pressure from EVERYONE to sleep train my baby because I have very serious sleeping issues myself - so we hired a sleep consultant and went for it. After a couple weeks I was hospitalized because I hadn‚Äôt slept well in months, and since we started the sleep training I had slept less than 15 minutes in 5 days. My baby never stopped crying the entire time, and even for naps was freaking out which had never been the case before. We had a very good night time routine already in place. The sleep consultant gave us a full refund. 

When I got out of the hospital 5 weeks later, I decided to cosleep and actually try to sleep whenever my baby slept. Magic! Suddenly I could nap (I‚Äôve never been able to nap) for sometimes up to an hour during baby‚Äôs 2 hour naps. For someone who struggles to sleep more than 3 hours a day, this was absolutely life altering. When my maternity leave was over we shifted the routine to my partner, who was going back to school, and he handled bedtime from there out - that actually made weaning way easier when it came time, because my kid was already used to his dad putting him to bed at night. Then Covid hit and I was laid off, so I napped with little bud every day and his dad did bedtime routine. 

My kid is an excellent sleeper and kept his 2 hour nap until about a month ago (he‚Äôs 4.5). He sleeps in his own bed through the night, we just lie down with him and sing a lullaby or 2 and he is out cold usually mid song. He used to come find one of us in the middle of the night and jump in bed with us, but lately he‚Äôs been trying to stay in his own bed because his uncle told him he can‚Äôt come over to their house for a sleep over unless he can stay in his own bed all night.

reddit,Advocate,"I may get downvoted for saying this, but babies cry for a heck of a lot more reasons than to communicate an urgent need. Babies cry over loud noises that startle them or water not being exactly the right temperature or it's 3:42 on a Tuesday. They cry. The world is new and scary. They will get used to it. You're a fully formed adult and you know they are safe and okay (assuming you have fed them and burped them and they have a clean diaper and no symptoms of a serious illness). 

Older babies can absolutely learn cause and effect. My daughter is 1 now. She has cried over the most ridiculous things. I can't even let her see the remote because if she sees it and I hide it, she will MELT DOWN. I don't give it to her. I let her have her tantrum and try to distract her with something else. 

Babies cry when you first teach them independent sleep because it is unfamiliar. You know it's safe and they will be okay and you've tended to all of their needs. Of course they are going to fuss about it. You don't have to plop them down and walk away but you do need to give them space to work through their frustration.

Our youngest, slept in a bassinet next to our bed for 9 months, we transitioned him to a crib slowly (bassinet in the room next to the crib for a week etc) and we never let him cry more than 5-10 minutes max. He sleeps SO much better than his brother did at his age. 

Because of my experience, i do think CIO needs to be done with strict parameters, and i think done the ‚Äúold school‚Äù way we were told to, it‚Äôs straight up harmful. If your kid is left to scream until they give up because they know nobody is coming to help them, yeah that‚Äôs trauma. I remember being told that when he went quiet, that meant he was self-soothing. He wasn‚Äôt. He wasn‚Äôt in any way at all ‚Äúsoothed‚Äù, he was just laying wide awake in the dark looking lost and lonely. He just knew he might as well stop crying for help because nobody was coming.","If your kid is left to scream until they give up because they know nobody is coming to help them, yeah that‚Äôs trauma.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqpoym/,livin_la_vida_mama

reddit,Advocate,"If you had asked me when I was pregnant, I would have told you I would NEVER sleep train or let my child cry it out AT ALL. I was adamantly against it. For the first several months of her life, my daughter was an excellent sleeper and I felt very comfortable in my anti-sleep training stance.  


Then at 8mo she went through an awful regression. She went to bed fine, but she started only sleeping for 40-90 minutes at a time. She would wake up SCREAMING and only fall asleep if we were holding her. She would scream every time we tried to put her back in the crib. I'm only 5' tall so I could barely reach the mattress of the crib to try to put her down asleep, and she is such a light sleeper that it would wake her up most of the time anyway. I had some success with using a heating pad to heat her crib before I put her down and make the transition less jarring, but eventually that stopped working too.   


I would spend hours and hours trying to get her back into the crib. I went entire nights with zero sleep and started having health issues and mental breakdowns because of it. I'm a SAHM, so I did all the overnight stuff by myself after 10pm because my husband needed sleep for his very detail-oriented job.   


I tried every gentle training method I could find. I spent hours researching. None of it worked. Either of us being in the room made her more upset 100% of the time, unless we were rocking her to sleep but by this time it was impossible to put her down asleep. She woke up immediately every time.  


Finally my husband put his hands on my shoulders and told me we needed to try some form of CIO. He said he was worried about me and that it was not healthy for me to continue this way, and that in order for me to be able to parent our child I needed sleep. He was absolutely right. I was at the point where I was feeling delusional from lack of sleep and it was not safe for me or my daughter. We decided to try a timed CIO method where if she was crying we would go in every 25 minutes, comfort her, put her back down in the crib (she would start crying again immediately), and leave. We have a video monitor and if she seemed like she was starting to settle down, we would extend the timer and not disturb her.   


I felt sooooooooooo much guilt and had to wear noise cancelling headphones during the 25 minute timer. But it worked amazingly well. Within a week she was sleeping great and rarely crying when she woke up, she would just go back to sleep. She started waking up in a great mood instead of being cranky every morning. I felt like a human being again. We've had to retrain a few times and now that she's 2yo and understands more, we're able to use more gentle methods which I prefer. But timed CIO was the right choice for us at the time.","it worked amazingly well. Within a week she was sleeping great and rarely crying when she woke up, she would just go back to sleep.

reddit,Oppose,"I was pro CIO when my first was born and I'm against CIO for the most part now. But with your edit I'm curious about what *you* mean by CIO.

CIO in general is usually tied to sleep training - wherein if your baby cries when you put them in their crib you let them cry (indefinitely or for a certain period of time) so they can ""self-soothe"" and essentially extinguish the crying response in that circumstance. We had a rule with my first that we'd never let him cry more than 5 minutes and when he was a baby we were never tested on it -- he fussed for 1-2 minutes and then was fine.

That said, I'm of the opinion that sleep training in general doesn't really work and that kids ""regress"" in that training basically at every milestone, which means you just have to go through the whole process again. Which can get pretty harrowing quickly. Better to establish good sleep hygiene and then support as needed.

As far as babies and kids crying in GENERAL: i believe it's totally healthy and normal. I also believe that kids can't really regulate themselves on their own until they're around 4, so if my kid is going to have a massive cry I am going to be there for it. Usually just being there to calmly support my kid ends the tantrum or the crying spell fairly quickly, but on the odd occasion it doesn't I just ride the wave with him, I don't leave him alone -- I think that just makes it scarier for him. FWIW I don't think it's the same as CIO if your baby is crying and you're there. crying isn't bad -- crying alone is.

reddit,Oppose,"Its been so  lnteresting reading all these answers and has really confirmed for me that each and every baby is a unique and different person, just like every parent/adult is. 

Which means that when it comes to best supporting and dealing with the sleep needs of your family the ""Right"" answers will not be the same. 

For myself no, on cry it out or any versions of it. I will not leave my babies to cry alone for longer at night than I do during the day. Why? I honestly don't think it would be a good/ effective method for either of them.  And it goes against my personal values and parenting philosophy.  

I've cried myself to sleep before and it feels crappy. If my best friend or partner cried to me in the middle of the night I'd not ignore them. So,  I choose not to treat my babies less responsively then I'd treat other loved ones or would want for myself. 

Ive read all the research and they all have limitations and don't give conclusive answers. Even the ones touted as supporting cry it out or extinction sleep training show no long term benefits to sleep over control groups. So, I see no compelling reasons to go against my instincts and preferences.  

This isn't because I can't stand to hear them crying.  It's OK if my babies cry, we all cry sometimes and the world is a big confusing and frustrating place when your little (and sometimes as an adult too) what's important to me is that they know I am here for them and they can trust they have my care, support, love as best I can.  

Sometimes the situation doesnt allow for much. I mean both my kiddos didn't love the car when infants and I couldn't pick them up while driving obviously- but I would still do what I could, like talk and sing to them- but they've fallen asleep in the car after screaming in traffic for 45 min (sometimes the commute is rough). And if I'm cooking dinner or something and can't attend to them immediately I just tell them ""sorry sweetie,  I know you want mommy right now and I'm in the middle of this,  I'll pick you up when I'm done"" kind of response. But if I CAN then I will. And if I can't I do my best,  explain (even before they understand) and follow through with my promises - like picking them up when I'm done.

reddit,Advocate,"I'm all for CIO, but 20 months old is too old for it. CIO is better for younger babies with simpler minds who can't understand you talk. The 6-9 month old baby has nothing else to do in the crib other than cry or try to sleep. You can't explain to a 6-9 mo baby that he can fall asleep without being rocked or nursed to sleep, he should just close his eyes and relax and sleep will come. So you leave them alone and hope that he figures it out eventually when he's sufficiently tired. 

But a 20 mo probably already knows that it's possible to fall asleep without help (unless you are still rocking them to sleep?) But they have much more complicated feelings about being lonely or anxious or scared of the dark or wanting to play more. CIO is no longer a good tool to address all those feelings and preferences. Plus a 20 mo can try to climb out of the crib/bed, bang their head against the crib, take off their diaper, and all kinds of unpredictable and possibly dangerous stuff.

Many toddlers who were previously sleep-trained will have sleep regressions at around 1.5-2.5 yo because of the emergence of said complicated feelings. The parents may have to sit with the kid until they fall asleep, for a period of weeks or months, before the toddler is once again ""settled"" and is okay with a quick goodnight.

reddit,No Position,"I am a nanny. I've been in the child care field for over 15 years. I worked for a family who let their baby cry it out. They had a system. You lay the baby down while they're sleepy but awake. Make sure they are fed and changed before doing so. If they cry, let them cry for 20 mins max and then go up and either try rocking to calm them down, or just bring them out and try again later. This method worked. The second day, the baby cried for only 5 mins and fell asleep. By the end of the week, this kid was soothing themselves to sleep immediately. I now work for a family that is very lax about routines. I have to rock the baby to sleep in my arms and then try oh so carefully to lay them in their crib without waking them. It's a little stressful.

reddit,Advocate,"We did cry it out for our little girl at 8 months old. We co-slept before because she was a dreadful sleeper and did not want to be separated from her mum, completely understandable. However she started getting too big and we were waking her up as she wanted more space to move around. We transitioned first to a cot in our room, then to her own room. She cried it out first night for about 20 minutes but it quickly became shorter and shorter, within a week there was minimal fuss. My wife was against it initially but with her returning to work it became clear for our own sanity something had to change. Sleeplessness is damaging for the whole family, and it might be selfish for us to say, we wanted our evenings back and a regular routine established. 

Tips for those wanting to try it, wait until little one is able to eat a decent evening meal, otherwise they‚Äôll be waking up hungry. Be firm and clear with one another before you start, if you leave them to cry for 15 mins and then comfort them because you can‚Äôt stand it any more, it‚Äôs a waste of time and it‚Äôll take a lot longer. If one of you needs a breather, leave the house for a short time. And obviously keep an eye on your monitor to make sure they are safe, perhaps leave a bottle of water in their crib if you think they‚Äôll be thirsty.

I seriously threw all the parenting books out because none of them worked and every baby is different any way. 

What I suggest is try different things and once you find something that works constancy is key. Children need routines and that's  a fact. :) 

My baby couldn't sleep unless I was facing him. I had him in his crib and would sleep on the floor next to him for the first few weeks. It was awful anytime I tried to go into the other room to sleep. He would cry four hours if i didnt sleep right there. I knew this wasn't sustainable but I didn't know what else to do and I was DESPERATE for sleep. 

I then got the idea from a friend to slowly each night move a bit farther away from the crib and eventually I'd be in my bed. After a week of shifting spots I was finally back in my bed. 

I am sure that if I didn't start sleeping on the floor in his room I could have spared me some back pain. But I was young and paranoid that my first ever tiny human would stop breathing in the night or something, and I had so much anxiety around that.

Again, we are all mothers trying to do our best. You get a gold star in my book for being a mom who is at least trying.

For weeks I tried ‚Äògentle‚Äô methods that left him utterly upset. There was A LOT of crying and not much progress. My mental health started to take a nosedive.

It took a few tough days (understatement) but now he‚Äôs sleeping in his own little floor bed and for the most part sleeps through the night. I still nurse him to sleep for naps during the weekends as I love the cuddles (instead of dreading it).

reddit,Advocate,"I never used any specific method for mine, I would just base if I went to comfort based on the intensity of the cry. I was very nervous about letting her cry it out as well, believing that it meant she needed me or needed the comfort. I don‚Äôt use any specific night-time routine with her either so she‚Äôs not overly attached to a specific rhythm. 

I just keep the daytime schedule the same for her, and at night she‚Äôs predictably tired around the same time, give or take half an hour. I make her as comfortable as I can by making sure she‚Äôs dry and has a full tummy and put her down. She‚Äôll cry the second I set her down in the crib but I‚Äôll just say goodnight, walk away to where she can‚Äôt see me and then listen to how she cries. If she starts crying slower and softer then she‚Äôs just fighting sleep, if she cries steady for more than about 10 minutes I‚Äôll peek at her to see if she‚Äôs okay (usually she just manages to get her legs through the sides of the crib and is uncomfortable) but I otherwise will not intervene or attempt to comfort unless her cries sound like she‚Äôs becoming distressed which isn‚Äôt very often. I know it seems like babies cry because they need comfort sometimes, but unless they‚Äôre seriously distressed it‚Äôs more about want than need.

reddit,No Position,"I can‚Äôt find the article, but it was one of the better research articles I‚Äôve read, basically said: CIO, statistically, does not help kids sleep more. Rather, babies who have CIO just cry less when they do wake up in the middle of the night. They don‚Äôt necessarily go back to sleep faster, they just stop asking their parents to comfort them. The point of the article basically said, do CIO if you as a parent don‚Äôt have the ability to comfort your child back to sleep, but don‚Äôt fool yourself into thinking you‚Äôre doing it for the child. The child doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlearn how to comfort themself‚Äù as a lot of CIO proponents suggest, they just stop asking for help (by crying).

I‚Äôm pretty biased, my wife and I have coslept with our 18mo old since birth (although we‚Äôre now transitioning him to a little mattress next to ours on the floor because we have a second on the way. Regardless of what the research says, my core belief is that CIO teaches your kid that you will not meet a need they have. Now, is that going to irreparably harm your kid, no? We can‚Äôt reasonably meet every single need our kids have, and there are plenty of other ways you can meet your kids needs. Comforting them to sleep is just one way to do so. And, I think that if comforting your child to sleep is making a parent miserable and sleep-deprived, it‚Äôs better to be a well rested happy parent than a sleep deprived bitter parent.

So, ultimately I think it depends on the kid and the parent, really on the parent. I don‚Äôt know of any kids who respond poorly to being comforted to sleep. I have heard horror stories of CIO gone wrong, like kids ending up with really disregulated sleep patterns. The complaint I hear about comforting to sleep is that the parents get tired of it at some point or can‚Äôt figure out a way to do it effectively so they can also get enough rest. 

So, I think the choice should really be made based on what you as a parent think you‚Äôre capable of (being honest with yourself is ok), and also seeing how your kid responds. Like, some kids seem to take better to CIO than others. I think the danger of CIO is that a lot people say to keep doing it until it works because it eventually will. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. If you are going to do it, set a limit on how many days/wks you‚Äôre willing to try it out, and if your kid doesn‚Äôt respond, stop.","So, I think the choice should really be made based on what you as a parent think you‚Äôre capable of (being honest with yourself is ok), and also seeing how your kid responds.

Kid 1 from the start demanded her own space. She didn't want to be with us, so we sectioned off a portion of the living room to create a bedroom for her and she slept through the night from the start. She was that first baby all parents dream about, lol.

Kid 2 slept with me in the bed, as I didn't have room for a crib or pack n play. She slept well, woke up 1x a night for a bottle (was unable to breastfeed, sadly). We shared a bed til she was around 5 or so.

Kid 3 went back and forth between his pack n play and our bed. He actually slept in the pack n play for several years before outgrowing it lol. He was sleeping through the night at 4 months.

I'm currently on Kid 4, he's almost 7 weeks. We are breastfeeding, though a few times a week he gets one bottle, it depends on what kind of cluster feeding he has been doing. The past 3 nights (1 after a formula bottle, 2 without) he has slept a solid 3 1/2 to 4 hours in his crib before wanting to nurse, then gone back down for another 2 or 3 hours. Sometimes he sleeps next to me after a nursing session, but normally I try to lay him back down. We're progressing well for a newborn.

Responding to my kid's cries works better for my own peace of mind. Kid 3 is 6 now and when he first transitioned to his big boy bed he'd first have to cuddle with me in my bed, then we'd carry him to his. Now he sleeps alone and we cuddle in the morning instead.","No, I've never done cio.

I can't stand listening to him cry for periods of time, but I've been trying to wait longer and longer before picking him up, but nothing seems to make a difference.  I could have the perfect bedtime routine, and he might fall asleep the moment his head hits the proverbial pillow, but a half hour later he wakes up and won't go back to sleep often past midnight! Sometimes he cries and wants to nurse, but sometimes he's happy and playing in his crib!
That said, I seriously suspect autism for other reasons, and I recently read that autistic babies struggle with sleep, so maybe it's to do with that?
I know for some crying it out is what they need. But for me if my baby is flat out screaming and I'm just ""ignoring him,"" that feels abusive. I usually end up co-sleeping at least part of the night since we're nursing, and his crib is right next to the bed, partially for convenience, partially because we live in my brother's basement, and partially because I've had a lot of health issues this year, including a gallbladder removal that prohibited lifting and carrying more than 10 pounds for 8 weeks (I gave up strictly following that at about week for because I was sick of someone always having to bring my baby to me).","But for me if my baby is flat out screaming and I'm just ""ignoring him,"" that feels abusive",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikt8za2/,Kimbyssik

Crying is the only way your child can communicate that something is wrong. If you ignore them, their stress levels rise to a point where they are no longer physiologically able to maintain it and they shut up.
They are mortally afraid for so long that exhaustion takes over.

reddit,Advocate,"Late to the party here - but we never - ever - co-slept or coddled bed times. Even as an infant. There was day time and there was night time. As an infant - night time starts at the last feeding before we go to bed(usually around 8pm). What that means is infant eats, burps, is swaddled and laid down. We don't snuggle, play, pick her up or anything until its time to eat again. When its time to eat, we unwrap her, change her, feed her, burp her and right back in the swaddle and right back down. This worked for our (now two year old) who has been sleeping through the night since she was 3 months old. This sets them up to understand that night time is bed time, even if the infant needs to eat every few hours she'll have this routine with her forever. Night time is not a time for cuddles or play - its a time to sleep. 

The two year old gets a wind-down routine: quiet play an hour before bed (no screens!), potty (in training), teeth brushed, changed into jammies and sleep sack, pick a stuffie to bring with you then we rock her and read a book while she drinks her milk, then bed. I'm a little lenient and let her pick a few books to read if she wants, but by the second or third book she's done. If she's up early in the morning and we're not ready to get her up, she sits in her crib and sings and plays for no more than an hour before we get her. 

At times you HAVE to let them cry it out. All you ever teach a child who cries and gets attention is that they will ALWAYS get attention by acting like that. Our two year old has gone through two different sleep regressions where she was tough to put down and keep down or she'd pop back up with the slightest sound and start screaming. DO NOT CODDLE THEM! Though extraordinarily painful we once let her cry for an hour straight after several 'resets' and attempts and you know what - she went down. Its heart breaking and at times feels cruel - but you will all get through it. The regressions each lasted about a week, and each time we introduced new factors to sort of reset her brain.

I would never change this routine for my kids. It worked extremely well for our two year old and our infant often times has to be woken up to eat at night.

Just like they need to be taught everything else from riding a bike to self-sufficiency. Sleep is SO important for development and overall well-being. Especially on those teenage years. 

I‚Äôve read a ton of research on CIO. Peoples biggest concern is that their children will develop abandonment issues. But there is no evidence of this from research and case studies that have extended 20+ years. If someone disagrees, please post the study.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to hear your LO cry, I know. It‚Äôs gut wrenching. But I promise it‚Äôll be in their favor in the long run. Check out that book if you want.

Psychiatrists and psychologists agree with you. 

You are correct, and you're being downvoted by shitty parents unwilling to admit they were wrong. (same with spanking)

reddit,Advocate,We did the ferber method with my oldest at 4months old it took 2 days of crying for about an hour the first day 20min the next and after that he has been a great sleeper. Before we sleep trained he was a terrible sleeper so much so that we didnt average more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day for those first 4 months. We were so tired that we were pretty much delirious. Once he was sleeping better we were able to be much better parents to him because we weren't completely exhausted. My 2nd is currently 3.5months and he already sleeps a solid 6hr chunk at night and then will wake up every 2 hours after that until morning which is normal. We probably wont sleep train him beyond breaking some sleep associations he has. Everyone has to look at their own situation and decide what is best for their family and the child as an individual.,Once he was sleeping better we were able to be much better parents to him because we weren't completely exhausted.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnlr6/,badpanda22

reddit,Oppose,"Link me one study within the last 20 years that thinks letting your child cry itself to sleep without intervention is healthy. 

I'm not a psychologist, but I studied psychology in college and was a substance abuse counselor for years. (different, admittedly)

This is true, and the author lists at least 8 studies that support the gist of her article. 

I'm not being snarky, I genuinely can't find any modern studies that agree with letting them just cry it out. If you have any evidence to support your claim, I would be very interesting in reading over journal articles. 

When presented with good data, I'm apt to change my mind about anything. 

Thanks.

Edit

This refutes the one study I found that says it has neither a negative or positive impact. https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.13390",Link me one study within the last 20 years that thinks letting your child cry itself to sleep without intervention is healthy. ,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/iku0zfx/,Ericrobertson1978

The refuting piece you shared above isn't an article, its a commentary.
