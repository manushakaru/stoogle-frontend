Since 1980, automation through digital technologies accounts for 50% to 70% of the rise in between-group inequality in the U.S. AI's potential economic impact could reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, possibly increasing productivity growth from 1.5% to 2.5%. The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has a 50% likelihood between 2040 and 2065, with 18% of experts fearing catastrophic outcomes.",
