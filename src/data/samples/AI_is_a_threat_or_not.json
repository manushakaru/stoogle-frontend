A considerable portion of occupations in the United States, around two-thirds, are susceptible to automation. Globally, 30% of workers express concerns about AI replacing their jobs within the next three years, with even higher anxiety levels in countries like India. The long-term impact is evident, as 45 million jobs in America could be replaced by 2030. Historical data suggests that automation significantly contributes to wage stagnation, affecting economic conditions over the past four decades. Additionally, 14% of the workforce has already faced job displacement due to AI or automation.",
