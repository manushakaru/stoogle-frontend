The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is projected to rise significantly by 2050, particularly in low Human Development Index (HDI) countries, where an increase of approximately 147.8% is expected. Variability in age-standardized incidence rates is partly attributed to changes in Socio-Demographic Indexes (SDIs).",
