In healthcare, 60% of U.S. adults feel uncomfortable with AI, despite 38% expecting better health outcomes. Concerns include AI's impact on patient-provider relationships, with 57% fearing it will worsen. However, 51% believe AI could reduce bias in healthcare. Additionally, three-quarters of Americans worry about the rapid adoption of AI by healthcare providers. Notably, a project has successfully used AI to predict SIDS with 94% accuracy.",
