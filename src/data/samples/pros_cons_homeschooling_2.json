The number of homeschooled children doubled from 1999 to 2012 and continued to rise, reaching 3.1 million students during the 2021-2022 school year. This reflects a notable increase from 2.5 million in 2019, with the homeschooling population growing at rates between 2% to 8% annually. Approximately 6% to 7% of school-age children are now educated at home, highlighting a shift towards this educational approach.",
