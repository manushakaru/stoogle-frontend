review,No Position,Behavioral sleep interventions in the first six months of life do not improve outcomes for mothers or infants: a systematic review,"Pamela S Douglas, Peter S Hill",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24042081/,United Kingdom,2013,0,109,yes,2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"From Kempler: The Douglas and Hill review differs in some important ways from the current study. Many of the studies included were based on surveys, longitudinal studies or pre and post designs, hence, their narrative was broader and potentially more subjective. Our results do not concur with this finding, in that we found a clear effect of interventions on sleep administered in the perinatal period for infant nocturnal total sleep time. It should be noted, however, that of the interventions administered in early infancy (i.e., within 6 mo), none of the interventions used employed controlled crying or camping out techniques. "
