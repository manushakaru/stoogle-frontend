            "description": "This cluster discusses significant facts about climate change and its historical context. The Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago, and significant climate events include the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago and the Little Ice Age a few hundred years ago. Currently, 1 in 3 natural sites and 1 in 6 cultural heritage sites are threatened by climate change. CO2 concentrations have dramatically increased from historical levels, with recent measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory showing 408 ppm in 2018, up from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm. The global average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1\u02daC since pre-industrial times, with recent decades experiencing accelerated warming. Efforts to address climate change include international conferences and protocols like the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to reduce emissions to below 1990 levels.",

Since the early 1980s, it has been the warmest 40-year period in at least eight centuries. Notably, 2016 had the warmest surface temperatures since records began in 1880, and 2023 experienced record-breaking monthly temperatures, with every month ranking among the top seven warmest. Extreme weather events have become more costly, with 2021 and 2017 having the most mega-disasters over $20 billion each. The summer of 1988 and 1987 were also notably hot years. Hurricane Irma in 2017 set a record with sustained winds of 185 miles/hr.",

Since the 1950s, Arctic sea ice has been declining, with the September sea ice declining by 13% per decade. The Arctic may experience sea-ice-free summers more frequently with increased global warming. Sea levels have been rising, with an increase in the rate of rise from roughly 3.3 mm/yr between 1993 and the present to 4.4 mm/yr from 2010 to 2018. Future projections suggest sea levels could rise by up to one meter by 2100 due to greenhouse gases. Glacier melt has also increased significantly over the decades.",
