AI experts express fears of catastrophic outcomes akin to nuclear-level disasters. A movement of nearly 28,000 signatories advocates for pausing advanced AI development. Employment forecasts predict technology will create over 69 million jobs while displacing 83 million in the next decade, with a 23% change in occupations. Moreover, 17% of Pakistani jobs are at risk of automation, and AI-driven automation could disproportionately affect low-income countries by replacing lower-skilled jobs. Safety in AI development is underemphasized, with only 2% of top papers addressing it, in contrast to the 98% focusing on more powerful systems. Additionally, deepfakes improve daily, AI surveillance is expanding in 75 countries, and lethal autonomous drones pose new threats. The potential for AGI development is seen as 50% likely by 2040-2065, with some fearing existential risks.",
