AWS leads with a 31% share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Despite facing competition from AI initiatives like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, Amazon's market share continues to grow, although AWS's growth rate is slower compared to its competitors. Investments in AI startups, such as Anthropic, highlight Amazon's strategic moves to bolster its position in the generative AI sector.",
