While 85 million jobs may be displaced by 2025, 97 million new roles could emerge. AI's economic impact is estimated to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030. In the U.S. and Europe, 300 million jobs may be affected, and AI-driven job disruption is notably impacting white-collar jobs. Training programs like SkillsFuture are crucial to adapt to these changes. AI investments are expected to grow substantially, and automation could lead to the loss of 60% of jobs in advanced economies.",
