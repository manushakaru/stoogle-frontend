"Is anyone else frustrated by the anti-sleep training mentality on social media? I get that it may work for some babies to skip out on sleep training, but I think some babies will simply not get enough sleep without it.",instagram,reddit,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/v1syro/do_you_find_that_instagram_is_really_judgmental/

"We did CIO at 4.5 months,  <span class=bold>cried 5 minutes</span>, has slept 12 hours a night ever since. <span class=advocate>It’s a dream</span>.

I did the <span class=bold>Ferber Method</span> with both of my kids. It took 2 nights for both. They are excellent sleepers and have been ever since.

Before we <span class=bold>Sleep Trained</span> he was a terrible sleeper so much so that we didnt average more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day for those first 4 months. We were so tired that we were pretty much delirious. Once he was sleeping better we were able to be <span class=advocate>much better parents</span> to him because we weren't completely exhausted.,divided,reddit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnlr6/

It is harmful. Insecure attachment in infants *is* a predictor of poor mental health in adulthood. It is an awful thing to do to a baby and I think less of everyone who employs it.,attachment,reddit,-9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wr4zn8/the_dividing_question_letting_your_baby_cry_it_out/ikqnff2/
