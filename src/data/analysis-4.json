Public sentiment is mixed, with 54% of Americans cautious and 22% scared about AI advancements, though 19% are excited. Additionally, 52% of workers believe AI will aid career growth, but 39% express workplace concerns. GDPR and GINA reflect regulatory responses, and Meta has restricted AI use in political campaigns.

Additionally, AI surveillance systems are being expanded in at least 75 countries. Ethical concerns arise with AI applications, such as China's plan to use a social credit system to score its citizens and the potential deployment of autonomous weaponized drones. Historical misuse of data, like Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data, highlights the importance of responsible AI deployment.",
