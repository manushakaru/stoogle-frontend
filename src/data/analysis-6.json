            "description": "The cybersecurity market is projected to grow by 12.4% annually until 2027, driven by increased investment in AI-enabled security tools, with over 70% of large organizations planning such investments. Meanwhile, phishing attacks have drastically increased by 1,265% due to generative AI platforms. Despite these threats, only 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured, and the average cost of data breaches is estimated at USD 4.88 million by 2024. Public concern over AI risks is high, with 59% of US adults prioritizing AI risk mitigation, though the median risk of extinction from AI is considered to be 5% and catastrophic outcomes 16%. Additionally, AI advancements are notable, with GPT-4 achieving top scores in a bar exam simulation and predictions for AI surpassing human intelligence moving from 2060 to 2047. China's social credit system will assign a personal score to its citizens based on behavior, affecting their social standing.",

AI's capabilities are rapidly advancing, already achieving superhuman performance in many areas, and are expected to continue improving. By 2030, AI-human collaboration will be essential to manage these changes, though it might also lead to permanent job loss for many and be used in warfare.",
